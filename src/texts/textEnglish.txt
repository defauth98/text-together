Chris Gardener: Hey, Jay.

Martin Frohm: Chris, sit down please.

Chris Gardner: I thought I’d wear a shirt today, you know, being the last day and all.

Martin Frohm: Well thank you, thank you, we appreciate that. But wear one tomorrow though okay, because tomorrow’s going to be your first day, if you’d like to work here as a broker. Would you like that Chris?

Chris Gardner: Yes sir.

Martin Frohm: Good, we couldn’t be happier. So welcome. Was it as easy as it looked?

Chris Gardner: No sir, no sir it wasn’t.

Martin Frohm: Well, good luck Chris.

Chris Gardner: Thank you, thank you sir.

Martin Frohm: Oh Chris, I almost forgot.

Chris Gardner: Thank you.

Chris Gardner: This part of my life, this little part, is called happiness.
